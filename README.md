A network monitoring tool for Linux. The UI is written in GTK. The bash 
parsing scripting is written in Awk but I would like to convert it into C code and add it to the GUI source code.
The program monitors all iPv4 TCP for traffic and if any port other than 80/443 are open the UI is launched.
I would like to tighten the program up and build on it. Combine everything into one file.
